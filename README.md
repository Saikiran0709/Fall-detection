Fall detection systems are critical for ensuring the safety and well-being of elderly individuals, particularly those living independently or in assisted living facilities. Leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, these systems can provide real-time monitoring and alerting in the event of a fall, enabling prompt assistance and intervention. These systems enable timely detection of falls and rapid response, reducing the risk of injury and minimizing the impact of falls on elderly individuals' health. Moreover, fall detection systems can provide peace of mind to caregivers and family members, knowing that their loved ones are being monitored and protected. Additionally, these systems can support healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at higher risk of falls and implementing preventive interventions, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving outcomes for elderly populations. Existing fall detection systems often rely on rule-based algorithms or simple threshold-based approaches, which may be prone to false alarms or fail to accurately detect falls in real-world scenarios. These systems may struggle to differentiate between falls and other activities, such as sitting down or bending over, leading to false positives or missed detections. Moreover, traditional systems may be limited by the types and placement of sensors, potentially missing falls that occur in non-standard positions or locations. Additionally, these systems may lack adaptability and scalability, making them less suitable for diverse environments and user populations. The proposed system aims to address the limitations of existing fall detection systems by leveraging machine learning techniques and IoT sensors data. This work explores the use of supervised learning algorithms to train models on sensor data collected from wearable and ambient IoT devices. By incorporating features such as acceleration patterns, orientation changes, and spatial context, the proposed models can learn to accurately detect falls while minimizing false alarms.
